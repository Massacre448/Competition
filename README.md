# Competition

This GitHub repository contains the source code for three different tasks, each of which is contained within its own folder. The three tasks are:

    Gra online - Online-Game
    Serwis bankomat√≥w - ATM-Service
    Transakcje - Transacions

## Online-Game

The task is to create an algorithm that determines the order in which players should be allowed to enter a special event within an online game. Players are grouped based on their clan membership and the strength of their clan is determined by the sum of their members' points. The algorithm should optimize the order of entry so that the maximum number of players can enter the event in one go.
## ATM-Service

The task is to prepare a system that will organize a list of service requests for a group of technicians responsible for maintaining ATMs. The requests include both planned and unplanned maintenance work. The list must be organized so that it can be completed in the most efficient manner possible, taking into account the priority of each request and the geographic locations of the ATMs.
## Transacions

The task is to create an algorithm that processes a large number of bank transactions, including both deposits and withdrawals, and returns a list of accounts sorted by their final balances. The algorithm should be able to handle up to 100,000 transactions.
## How to Run

Each of the three tasks is contained within its own folder. Please refer to the README.md file within each folder for instructions on how to run the corresponding algorithm.
